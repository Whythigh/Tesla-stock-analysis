# Prerequisites to make this analysis
There are many opinions on Tesla stocks. If we check the financial market, we will see that the vast majority of people trust Elon Musk and willingly buy Tesla's stocks. However, let us build a basic analysis on Tesla stocks (until 2017) to see how prices had been changed over set years. Afterwards, we try to conduct Monte Carlo Simulation using random values up to 10 000 to forecast its price and risks.
